    <h2>Kaitlyn Koon</h2>
    <p>As an introduction: I am a new student with very little experience in coding. I am majoring statistics, but will be minoring in programming, 
        so here I am! I don't have many hobbies, but the ones I can note include creative writing and swimming. I am 18 years old and female,
         and will be turning 19 in May. I graduated high school in the Seattle area last year, where I have lived my whole life. I love it 
         here and I plan to come back! For
        this winter semester, I am only online. But in the Spring I hope to be in Idaho attending most if not all my classes in person.</p>

    <p>So far, this course is already fun for me. It will be a great introduction to coding in general and I will be happy to continue
        learning how to program. For web design specifically, I am sure I will use what we learn in this class in my future, such as to
        present information during statistic classes.</p>

    <p>On the topic of faith, I have been a member of the church for as long as I can remember. However, that has been a lot of time
        that has allowed me to hold my faith in the background. I hope and pray for the next four years that I will grow my faith and find
        permanent habits to keep my faith strong for the rest of my life.</p>
